# CipherClock
Time Based Encryption and Decryption System
Message Encryption: 

CipherClock allows users to encrypt messages before sending them to other individuals, enhancing the security and confidentiality of their communication.

Messages sent using CipherClock can only be decrypted on the same day they were sent. The decryption process is tied to the specific date, adding an extra layer of security and privacy.

Manual Decryption: 

To decrypt a message received via CipherClock, the recipient must manually run the program and select the decryption option. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the decrypted content.

Secure Communication:

 While CipherClock does not send messages on behalf of users, it provides a secure and privacy-focused environment for exchanging sensitive information.

CipherClock is designed for individuals who prioritize data protection and need a reliable tool for secure messaging within a time-bound context.
